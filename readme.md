Assignment3 by Hao Tran and Daniel Tellez

Purpose:
  In this assignment, you will design and build a program that stores an arbitrary
  sequence of commands that manipulates and uses a drawing list. A drawing list is used
  to produce a graphical scene, e.g., [create a red rectangle, move it to coordinates (5,5),
  create a blue triangle, move it to coordinates (10,2), draw the red rectangle, draw the
  blue triangle]. While it would be fun to actually draw the shapes that we will store and
  manipulate in our list, we shall instead focus only on the creation and maintenance of
  the drawing list. NOTE: actually implementing drawing via JavaFX is worth 10 bonus
  pts.
